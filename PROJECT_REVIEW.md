## Critical Path Analysis

### üü¢ **GOOD:** Core Infrastructure (Days 1-2)
**Strengths:**
- Well-defined configuration files (agents.js, firebase.js, auth.js)
- Clear separation of concerns (components, screens, services, utils)
- OfflineQueue with NetInfo integration for robust sync

**Concerns:**
- **Missing:** Actual App.js, AgentsTab.js, AgentDetail.js, ToolsTab.js code
- **Action Required:** BUILD_README.md says "See the plan file" but those files need to be created

### üü° **CAUTION:** Hero Features (Days 3-4)
**Strengths:**
- Streaming voice transcription with Whisper fallback
- Native WebSocket for real-time updates
- Geolocation with MapView clustering

**Risks:**
- **Voice permissions** may fail on some iOS 18 devices (need error handling)
- **Geolocation accuracy** depends on API quality (add fallback mock data)
- **WebSocket reconnect** logic tested but untested in production

### üü° **CAUTION:** Offline Architecture (Days 5-6)
**Strengths:**
- Firebase offline persistence configured
- Sync queue with AsyncStorage backing
- Dark mode + Sabbath mode for church-specific UX

**Risks:**
- **Sync conflicts** possible if multiple actions queued (need timestamp validation)
- **Firebase quota** if large sermon drafts stored (add size limits)
- **Sabbath mode** requires timezone handling (complex edge case)

### üî¥ **RED FLAG:** Testing & Security (Days 7-8)
**Critical Issues:**
1. **JWT token injection** into WebViews is secure BUT requires backend validation
2. **Apple Guideline 4.2.6** compliance (religious apps) needs moderation plan
3. **Privacy policy** exists but needs in-app access (not just docs folder)
4. **Detox E2E tests** require iOS simulator setup (time-consuming)

### üü¢ **GOOD:** Wow Factor Features (Days 9-10)
**Strengths:**
- 3D Touch shortcuts enhance UX
- Siri Shortcuts integration
- iOS 17+ widget for daily verse

**Note:** These are nice-to-have, correctly deprioritized in fallback plan

6. `src/screens/GenZConnector.js` - Complete social component
7. `src/screens/MiracleTab.js` - Complete map component

**MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Days 3-4):
8. `src/utils/mockData.js` - Offline fallback data
9. Complete Firebase config with actual credentials
10. FCM push notification setup in app.json

**LOW PRIORITY** (Days 5-6):
11. Lottie animation files
12. Splash screen PNG (need church logo/verse artwork)
13. Privacy policy in-app access

---

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ **HIGH RISK**

1. **Apple Review Timeline**
   - **Issue:** 48-hour review buffer may not be enough for religious apps
   - **Impact:** Could miss Nov 4th deadline
   - **Mitigation:** Submit by Oct 31st (not Nov 2nd) for extra buffer
   - **Action:** Start TestFlight submission on Day 8, not Day 9

2. **WebView Memory Issues**
   - **Issue:** iOS 18 has stricter memory limits for WebViews
   - **Impact:** App could crash on older devices
   - **Mitigation:** `clearCache(true)` on unmount + test on iPhone 12 Pro minimum
   - **Action:** Add memory profiling in Phase 4

3. **Voice Recognition Accuracy**
   - **Issue:** Device Voice API varies by iOS version
   - **Impact:** Sermon prompts may be misheard
   - **Mitigation:** Whisper API fallback (good) BUT not implemented in code yet
   - **Action:** Add Whisper edge function by Day 3

4. **Firebase Offline Persistence**
   - **Issue:** Firestore offline cache can bloat AsyncStorage
   - **Impact:** App may crash after weeks of use
   - **Mitigation:** Add cache size limits + cleanup on launch
   - **Action:** Implement in Phase 3 (Day 5)

### üü° **MEDIUM RISK**

5. **Geolocation Privacy**
   - **Issue:** Users may deny location access
   - **Impact:** MiracleTab won't work
   - **Mitigation:** Graceful fallback with mock data
   - **Status:** Addressed in code with retry modal

6. **WebSocket Reconnection**
   - **Issue:** Exponential backoff tested but untested with high latency
   - **Impact:** Real-time social updates may lag
   - **Mitigation:** Native WebSocket is correct choice (good)
   - **Status:** Monitor Sentry for WebSocket errors in production

7. **Sabbath Mode Implementation**
   - **Issue:** Timezone handling for Sunday service hours
   - **Impact:** Notifications may fire at wrong times globally
   - **Mitigation:** Use device timezone + add configuration UI
   - **Action:** Add timezone logic to Phase 3

### üü¢ **LOW RISK**

8. **Siri Shortcuts**
   - **Impact:** Only affects "wow factor" not core functionality
   - **Fallback:** Correctly deprioritized in plan

9. **Dark Mode vs Church Blue**
   - **Issue:** Color contrast accessibility
   - **Mitigation:** Gold accents (#ffd700) provide contrast
   - **Status:** Compliant with WCAG AA standards
