**Note from Senior Engineer/Developer:** This is a GitHub-adapted version of the proprietary evaluation license, formatted as a LICENSE.md file (copy-paste into your repo's root). I've incorporated the NDA clause as Section 4, ensuring it's enforceable for confidential repo access (make the repo private on GitHub). This aligns with 2025 best practices: GitHub's license detection won't classify it as open-source, preserving your IP. No tools needed here—pure draft based on standards (e.g., similar to proprietary notices from Microsoft/GitHub Enterprise repos). To App Store ASAP: Once repo is licensed, we can share securely with evaluators like Dom & Tom. If this doesn't meet standards (e.g., add jurisdiction details), flag for corrections. Let's push this live!
